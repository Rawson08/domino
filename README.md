# Domino Game
### This game has 2 different version, first is the one which runs with the Standard Input/Output command, while the other one is the JavaFX implementation of the game with interactive UI.

### Currently, the game has wildcard method only for the player. The computer can not use wild card as it is supposed to work, instead it takes 0 as any other numbers and only places it next to another zero. It still has work to be done.

### You will be able to find the design diagram for the Console version of the game.
