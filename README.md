# DominoConsoleGame.Domino Game
##### This game has 2 different version, first is the one which runs with the Standard Input/Output command, while the other one is the JavaFX implementation of the game with interactive UI.

##### Currently, the game has wildcard method only for the player. The computer can not use wild card as it is supposed to work, instead it takes 0 as any other numbers and only places it next to another zero. It still has work to be done.

##### You will be able to find the design diagram for the Console version of the game. 

### Some changes possible for the game
 Currently, the shuffle method only shuffles the 28 dominos into different indexes but in the order they are created, i.e. [x, y] where x is always less than y. It can be further improved by shuffling around the dominos as well as rotating them randomly so that they are better shuffled and x can no longer always be less than y. But, that is something to be improved later on.
